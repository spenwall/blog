title: Creating an Azure Function entirely with Microsoft Documentation
date: 2019-07-29
description: I wanted to learn how to make a Azure serverless function and I decided that I wasn't going to look up any guides
or blog posts. I was only going to setup an account and follow as little documentation as possible to see how easy it was.

Things were fairly easy to get started. I signed up for an account and I heard alot about Azure functions on vs code, which is my editor of choice, so I decided to just go there and install the extension. I did so and added a new project and tried to run the function locally with F5. It gave me an error saying my node version was too new and so I downgraded to the latest LTE version.
