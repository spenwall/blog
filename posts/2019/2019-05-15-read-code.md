When you were young and learning how to write, the teacher didn't just teach you the alphabet and then told you to go write something. The first thing you do after you learn your letters is to read. You were told to read lots of books and to continue reading.

This is similar to learning to code. Once you learn some syntax and understand something you can go off and start writing code. I am not suggesting that you have to read a certain number of repositories before you can start writing. What I am suggesting is that you can learn a lot from reading other peoples code.

* Find reliable code
* Trace that code
* Use step debugging

## Find reliable code to read
This is an important one. There is a lot of code out there and if you are reading bad code you will probably write bad code as well. On the other side there is a lot of code that you can learn from out there. Github and other git repositories have a unlimited supply of code projects to learn from. I would suggest that you start on smaller projects and work your way up. Maybe there is a library that you use in your code and don't even think to how it works. Don't be afraid and get into the code and read how it works. You might not understand it all but you also might be surprised how much you can learn from it.
